## Project content

The project aims to find the moment in which a ship should take off in order to get to Mars. Inital conditions of the planets are taken from [here](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#top) the day 06/04/2020.

We use the following algorithms in order to estimate the date, the travel time, and the speed of the ship at the moment of arrival.

* Beeman
* Leapfrog
* Gear Predictor Corrector
